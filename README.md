# JavaScript Calculator

This simple calculator project is created for **learning purposes** to explore fundamental JavaScript concepts such as loops, DOM manipulation, event handling, and other key JavaScript features. The project focuses on understanding how to build a functional calculator and apply core JavaScript functionality to create a clean and interactive web-based tool.

The **color scheme** for the calculator is inspired by **Solarized Osaka**, a popular color palette known for its soothing tones and readability, creating an aesthetically pleasing and comfortable experience for users.

## Learning Objectives

- Loops: This project helped in learning how to use loops to dynamically generate elements such as buttons for numbers and operators.
- DOM Manipulation: By creating elements using JavaScript, I learned how to interact with the DOM efficiently.
- Event Handling: The calculator's buttons are interactive through event listeners, where I practiced handling different events like click.
- JavaScript Functions: Creating reusable functions (createElement, createButton) and handling calculator logic helped reinforce function usage and JavaScript concepts.

## Technologies Used

- HTML for structuring the content.
- CSS-in-JS for styling the calculator's layout.
- JavaScript for functionality, DOM manipulation, event handling, and loops.
